Pyright Unbound Variable Fix Report
=====================================
Date: 2025-08-26
Agent: Maintenance Agent

ISSUE SUMMARY:
- 1 unbound variable violation found in pyright report
- File: /Volumes/code/cywil/ai-paralegal-poc/tests/integration/test_openai_integration.py
- Line 176: Variable "i" was referenced before being defined

ROOT CAUSE:
The test method `test_concurrent_api_calls` had an unused variable `messages` that referenced the loop variable `i` before the for loop that would define it. The line was:
```python
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Generate a short response for test {i}"}]
```

FIX APPLIED:
- Removed the unused `messages` variable declaration on line 176
- This was safe to remove as the variable was never used elsewhere in the method
- The actual messages used in the test are properly defined within the for loop scope

VERIFICATION:
- Ran pyright on the fixed file - no unbound variable issues remain
- Only import resolution errors persist (expected in isolated testing)
- Generated clean diff showing only the problematic line was removed

DIFF:
```diff
-        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Generate a short response for test {i}"}]
+        
```

STATUS: âœ… RESOLVED
All unbound variable issues have been fixed successfully.
